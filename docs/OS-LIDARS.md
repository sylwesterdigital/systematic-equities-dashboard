Yes — there *are* open-source LiDARs (or LiDAR-like sensors) and 360° scanning LiDAR modules you can use with laptops, Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, etc. Depending on your precision, range, and scanning needs, you’ll choose different types. I’ll lay out the key options + pros/cons + some product examples.

## Key Types & What’s Possible

Here are types of LiDAR or distance sensors you might use, and how they integrate:

| Type                                          | Single-point vs scanning / 360°                                     | Open source / DIY possible?                                         | Power & data interface (Arduino, Pi, laptop)                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ToF (Time of Flight) single-point** sensors | single beam measuring distance to one point                         | Yes, many cheap modules, often with open specs or community support | Usually I2C / UART, low power; works well with Arduino/Pi                                     |
| **2D scanning LiDAR** (rotating or MEMS)      | scans a sweep (e.g. horizontal)                                     | Some low cost open modules exist; some require proprietary parts    | Requires more data, often more expensive; often use serial/UART, can stream to Pi/laptop      |
| **Solid state & MEMS LiDAR**                  | small FoV scanning, cheaper, fewer moving parts                     | Development in progress; more complex to DIY fully                  | More complex to interface, but doable especially with Raspberry Pi and proper driver software |
| **DIY / open source projects**                | you can build your own for lower resolution or narrow field of view | Yes (e.g. open source 3D scanner projects)                          | Depends on your hardware/design                                                               |

## What “360° LiDAR” Means

When people say “LiDAR 360,” they often mean a scanning LiDAR that rotates (or uses multiple lasers) to sweep a full circle (horizontal) around the device. These are more complex, need motors, encoders, more data, more power.

Fully open-source 360° LiDAR is harder to find because of mechanical complexity, safety & laser legal issues, and calibration. But there *are* modules you can get which provide nearly 360° scanning or wide coverage.

## Open Source LiDAR / Libraries / Projects

Some software / hardware projects and libraries to check:

* **“Awesome LiDAR”** list on GitHub: catalogs many sensors, community projects. ([GitHub][1])
* **Kitware’s LidarView**: open source platform for visualizing live 3D LiDAR data. ([lidarview.kitware.com][2])
* Open-source SLAM frameworks you can use with LiDAR data (to localize / map) — ROS-based, FAST-LIO2, etc. ([arXiv][3])

## What to Consider / Trade-Offs

When deciding:

* **Range**: how far do you need it to see? Single-point sensors often only up to 10-40 meters; 360° scanners vary.
* **Field of view (FoV)**: do you need a full circle, or just distance ahead / in front?
* **Update rate**: how fast do you need measurements? SLAM or real-time mapping requires many points per second.
* **Interface**: UART, I2C, USB, etc. Raspberry Pi / laptop easier with USB or serial; Arduino works well with simpler sensors.
* **Power**: scanning LiDARs often need more current and stable power.
* **Open-source driver/software**: ensure there are drivers or community support for your hardware platform.

If you tell me your budget, whether you need full 360°, range (meters), update speed, and platform (Pi / Arduino / laptop), I can suggest a few specific models that meet your needs. Do you want me to pick some based on your constraints?
